// This file configures the initialization of Sentry on the server. The config you add here will be used whenever
// the server handles a request. https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/

// We do not want sentry running for server side errors, GCP handles these.
// If you would like to enable Sentry for your server please get in contact with the platform Team.
